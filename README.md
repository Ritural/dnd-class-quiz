# Boilerplate!!!

_Last updated: 6 June 2019_

## Overview

This boilerplate consists of Webpack, TypeScript, React, Redux, and SCSS.

I often find myself creating new projects so I decided to make a boilerplate as a nice starting point.

## Application structure

```
- README.md
```

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following pre-requisites installed to run the project

- Git
- Node.js
- nvm
- yarn

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repo - `git clone git@github.com:Ritural/webpack-typescript-react-boilerplate.git`
1. Make sure you're using the correct node version with `nvm use`
1. In the root folder run `yarn install`.
1. Then run `yarn start`.
